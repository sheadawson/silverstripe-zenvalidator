# SilverStripe ZenValidator

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sheadawson/silverstripe-zenvalidator.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sheadawson/silverstripe-zenvalidator)


## Description

ZenValidator aims to make silverstripe form validation as painless as possible, by allowing configuration of serverside and clientside validation through one simple API.
[Parsley.js](http://parsleyjs.org/doc/index.html) is used for the clientside validation in the frontend.

## Installation

`composer require sheadawson/silverstripe-zenvalidator`

## SilverStripe 4 support

This version of the module only supports SilverStripe 4. The current version of the module try as much
as possible to remain compatible with previous code.
SilverStripe 4 support is pretty much work in progress so you can expect a few issues.

You can also check this other module that uses ParsleyJS as well:
https://github.com/praxisnetau/silverware-validator

Future versions of this module will break BC to promote namespaced classes and other improvements.

## SilverStripe 3 support

For SilverStripe 3 support, please use branch 1.

## Validation Constraints

Out of the box constraints include:

* required
* value (min, max, range)
* length (min, max, range)
* check (min, max, range)
* type (email, url, number, integer, digits, alphanumeric)
* equalto (equal to the value of another field)
* notequalto (not equal to the value of another field)
* regex
* remote (validate remotely via ajax)
* dimension (image width, height, aspect ratio. CMS only)
* dateOutside (checks value is equal to or outside a specified date boundary)
* dateInside (checks value is equal to or inside a specified date boundary)


## Usage examples

### Create a form, add ZenValidator.

```php
public function Form(){
    $fields = FieldList::create(array(
        TestField::create('Name'),
        TextField::create('Username'),
        TextField::create('Email'),
        TextField::create('FavoriteColor'),
        TextField::create('Age'),
        TextField::create('Website')
    ));

    $actions = FieldList::create(FormAction::create('submit', 'submit'));

    $validator = ZenValidator::create();

    return Form::create($this, 'Form', $fields, $actions, $validator);
}
```

The following examples demonstrate various ways to add constraints to the above form example.

### Required fields

The addRequiredFields() is available for quick and clean adding of required fields.

##### Required Fields - Basic

```php
$validator->addRequiredFields(array(
    'Name',
    'Email'
));
```

##### Required Fields - Custom Messages

```php
$validator->addRequiredFields(array(
    'Name'  => 'Please enter your name',
    'Email' => 'Please enter your email'
));
```

### Other Constraints

All other constraints are added via the setConstraint() method. This method takes 2 parameters: $fieldName and $constraint. See examples below.

##### Value Constraints

Test for number of min, max or between range value

Min
```php
$validator->setConstraint('Age', Constraint_value::create('min', 18));
```
Max
```php
$validator->setConstraint('Age', Constraint_value::create('max', 25));
```
Range
```php
$validator->setConstraint('Age', Constraint_value::create('range', 18, 25));
```

##### Length Constraints

Test for a min, max or between range length of string

Min
```php
$validator->setConstraint('Username', Constraint_length::create('min', 3));
```
Max
```php
$validator->setConstraint('Username', Constraint_length::create('max', 5));
```
Range
```php
$validator->setConstraint('Username', Constraint_length::create('range', 3, 5));
```

##### Check Constraints

Test for a min, max or range of elements checked

Min
```php
$validator->setConstraint('Options', Constraint_check::create('min', 3));
```
Max
```php
$validator->setConstraint('Options', Constraint_check::create('max', 5));
```
Range
```php
$validator->setConstraint('Options', Constraint_check::create('range', 3, 5));
```

##### Type Constraints

The Constraint_type constraint can be used to validate inputs of type email, url, number, integer, digits or alphanum. Pass one of said options as the first parameter into the constructor.

Email
```php
$validator->setConstraint('Email', Constraint_type::create('email'));
```

URL
```php
$validator->setConstraint('Website', Constraint_type::create('url'));
```

Number
```php
$validator->setConstraint('Age', Constraint_type::create('number'));
```

Integer
```php
$validator->setConstraint('Age', Constraint_type::create('integer'));
```

Digits
```php
$validator->setConstraint('Age', Constraint_type::create('digits'));
```

Alphanum
```php
$validator->setConstraint('Username', Constraint_type::create('alphanum'));
```

##### Equal To Constraint

Validates that the value is identical to another field's value (useful for password confirmation check).

```php
$validator->setConstraint('Username', Constraint_equalto::create('Name'));
```

##### Not Equal To Constraint

Validates that the value is different from another field's value (useful to avoid duplicates).

```php
$validator->setConstraint('Surname', Constraint_notequalto::create('FirstName'));
```

##### Regex validation

Check for a valid hex color, for exampleâ€¦

```php
$validator->setConstraint('FavoriteColor', Constraint_regex::create("/^#(?:[0-9a-fA-F]{3}){1,2}$/"));
```

##### Remote validation

Validate based on the response from a remote url. Validation is based on the response http status code. A status of 200 will validate, anything else will cause a validation error.

```php
$validator->setConstraint('Username', Constraint_remote::create($this->Link('checkusername')));
```

The above example will send an ajax request to my checkusername method on the same controller as the Form. A request var with a key the same as the field name will contain the value to test. So my checkusername method might look something like this:

```php
public function checkusername($request) {
    $username = $request->requestVar('Username');

    // check for existing user with same username
    if (Member::get()->filter('Username', $username)->count()) {
        return $this->httpError(400, 'This member already exists');
    } else {
        return $this->getResponse()->setBody('');
    }
}
```

All arguments/settings for the Constraint_remote constructor:

* $url - The URL to send the validation request to (do not include a query string, use $params)
* $params - An array of request vars to be sent with the request
* $options - An array of key => value options for the validator (eg: ['type' : 'POST', 'dataType' : 'jsonp'])
* $validator - Use a specific remote validator. Default validators are 'default' and 'reverse'

By default, ZenValidator uses a custom async validator that reads error message in your 4xx responses and display them
below the invalid field (instead of a generic message "this value seems invalid").

For serverside validation: if a relative url is given the response will be obtained internally using Director::test, otherwise curl will be used to get the response from the remote url.

#### Date Boundary constraints

These 2 constraints allow you to require an entered date to be either outside or inside a specified date boundary. The boundary is usually relative to the current date for example '-18 years' and can be used, for example, to ensure that the date of birth entered on a form is equal to or more than 18 years ago, or perhaps inside 120 years of the current date so people cannot enter dates dates too far in the past or greater than the current date.

Note that date boundaries can be in the past e.g. '-7 days' or in the future e.g. '+7 days'. Under the hood the constraints use PHP's strtotime() so any relative date string it supports will work.

##### dateOutside

Use this to require a date be equal to or outside the specified boundary.

In the case of boundaries less than the current date e.g. '-18 years' the value for the field must be equal to or less than (<=) the current date minus 18 years. So if used on a date of birth field this means the person must be 18 years or older.

```php
$validator->setConstraint(
    'DateOfBirth',
    Constraint_dateOutside::create('-18 years')
);
```

In the case of boundaries greater than the current date e.g. '+1 year' the value for the field must be equal to or greater than (>=) the current date plus 1 year.

```php
$validator->setConstraint(
    'TennacyEndDate',
    Constraint_dateOutside::create('+1 year')
);
```

##### dateInside

Use this to require a date to be between the current date and the specified boundary.

In the case of boundaries less than the current date e.g. '-120 years' the value for the field must be equal to or between the current date and the current date minus 120 years.

```php
$validator->setConstraint(
    'DateOfBirth',
    Constraint_dateInside::create('-120 years')
);
```

In the case of boundaries greater than the current date e.g. '+3 months' the value for the field must be equal to or between the current date and the current date plus 3 months.

```php
$validator->setConstraint(
    'ServiceStartDate',
    Constraint_dateInside::create('+3 months')
);
```

##### Convert slashes

If you are familiar with PHP's strtotime() function you will know that when dates values contain forward slashes (/) it is assumed the date is in the American format m/d/y (month, day, year) even if the user entered the date as d/m/y (day, month, year).

This can be an issue because in some countries users will want (or your website design specifies) to enter the date as d/m/y (not d-m-y or y-m-d) and this would cause strtotime() to parse the entered value incorrectly and the validation may not work as expected.

So to overcome this issue, you can pass true as the second parameter (convertSlashes) when specifying the constraint. If any slashes are found in the value they will be replaced with dashes (-) before the value is sent to strtotime() to get a timestamp when the validation runs.

```php
$validator->setConstraint(
    'ServiceStartDate',
    Constraint_dateInside::create('+3 months', true)
);
```

This does not alter the value of the field, so it will still have the value of d/m/y after the form is posted.

##### Boundaries relative to a date other than the current date

While in most cases you will want the date boundaries for these constraints to be relative to the current date (which is the default), it is possible to make those boundaries relative to a date you specify by passing a timestamp of that date as the third parameter when adding the constraint.

In the following example the value for the field must always be equal to or between the dates 2016-02-11 and 2016-05-11.

```php
$validator->setConstraint(
    'EventDate',
    Constraint_dateInside::create('+3 months', true, strtotime('2016-02-11'))
);
```

You can also specify an exact date boundaries by passing a date in as the first parameter when adding the constraint, this might be handy if the value for a field must be before or after a fixed point in time.

In the following example the value for the field must always be between 2016-01-01 and the current date.

```php
$validator->setConstraint(
    'StartDate',
    Constraint_dateInside::create('2016-01-01')
);
```

Be careful if specifying a fixed boundary because the constraint still takes in to account the current date; if you set the boundary to be a date in the future there will be issues when the current date equals or surpasses that boundary. Its safest to specify dates in the past if using a non-relative boundary.

##### Other things to note

The date boundary constraints will only run if a value has been entered in the field; You should still add the field to the required fields if it is required.

The date boundary validations will inform the user if the date they entered is invalid, so there is no need to also add a constraint to the field to check if it is a date when using dateInside or dateOutside.

As mentioned, by default the date boundaries are relative to the current date. Note this is without the time. If you need the time to be part of it then please pass in a timestamp as the third parameter when adding the validation.

### Setting Custom Messages

Any of the above examples can be configured to display a custom error message. For example:

```php
$validator->setConstraint(
    'FavoriteColor',
    Constraint_regex::create("/^#(?:[0-9a-fA-F]{3}){1,2}$/")
        ->setMessage('Please enter a valid HEX color code, starting with a #')
);
```

### Bulk setting of constraints

```php
$validator->setConstraints(array(
    'Name' => 'Age', Constraint_value::create('min', 18),
    'Username' => array(
        Constraint_required::create(),
        Constraint_type::create('alphanum'),
    )
));
```

The setConstraint() method is also chainable so you can:

```php
$validator
    ->setConstraint('Website', Constraint_type::create('url'))
    ->setConstraint('Content', Constraint_required::create());
```

### Removing constaints

```php
$validator->removeConstraint(string $fieldName, string $constraintClassname);
```
OR
```php
$validator->removeConstraints(string $fieldName);
```

### Customising frontend validation behaviour (Parsley)

It is likely that you may want to have your validation messages displaying in a custom element, with custom classes or any other custom frontend validation behaviour that is configurable with Parsley. In this case, you can set the third parameter ($defaultJS) of Zenvalidator's constructor to false.

```php
$validator = ZenValidator::create(null, true, false);
```

Or set globally via yml

```
ZenValidator:
  default_js: false
```

This will tell ZenValidator not to initialise with the default settings, and also to add the class "custom-parsley" to the form. You'll then need to add some custom javascript to the page with your own settings, for example:

```javascript
$('form.custom-parsley').parsley({
    errorsWrapper: '<div></div>',
    errorTemplate: '<small class="error"></small>',
    errorClass: 'error',
    errorsContainer: function ( elem, isRadioOrCheckbox ) {
        return $(elem).parents('.field:first');
    },
    excluded: 'input[type=button], input[type=submit], input[type=reset], input[type=hidden], :hidden, .ignore-validation'
});
```

Warning: $(elem).parsley() can return an array (in which can, attaching subscribe will fail) in case you match multiple forms. Use the following syntax instead if you need to match multiple elements:

```javascript
$.each($('form.parsley').parsley(),function(i,parsleyForm) {
    parsleyForm.subscribe('parsley:field:validate', function(field) { ... });
});
```

See [Parsley.js](http://parsleyjs.org/doc/index.html) for the full list of configuration settings

### CMS Usage

To use ZenValidator in the CMS, simply implement a getCMSValidator() method on your custom Page type or DataObject class

```php
public function getCMSValidator(){
    $validator = ZenValidator::create()->setConstraint(
        'Content',
        Constraint_required::create()->setMessage('Please enter some content')
    );

    // currently parsley validation doesn't work so well in the cms, so disable.
    $validator->disableParsley();

    return $validator;
}
```
#### Image Dimension Constraints (CMS only)

You can add constraints to image selection/upload fields to ensure that users are saving images of the correct size or shape, or that the image is of a minimum/maximum width and height to prevent issues with the display of the image in the site.

Note: the validation is run when the page is saved, not at time of image choosing or upload.

##### Width

Use this to require the width of an image to be a certain number of pixels. Handy if you require images to be an exact size.
```php
$validator->setConstraint('HeroImage', Constraint_dimension::create('width', 100));
```

##### Height

Use this to require the height of an image is the specified pixels.
```php
$validator->setConstraint('HeroImage', Constraint_dimension::create('height', 150));
```

##### Width and Height

Use this to require both the width and height are the specified pixels.
```php
$validator->setConstraint('HeroImage', Constraint_dimension::create('width_height', 100, 150));
```

##### Ratio

Use this to require images to be a certain shape, for example 6:4 photo, 5:5 square etc. Handy when you need an image to be a particular shape but are relaxed about the size as that might be dealt with by CSS.
```php
$validator->setConstraint('HeroImage', Constraint_dimension::create('ratio', 16, 9));
```

##### Min width

Use this to ensure the width of an image is equal to or greater than the specified pixels, handy to ensure that users don't use images which are too small and might loose quality if stretched by CSS.
```php
$validator->setConstraint('HeroImage', Constraint_dimension::create('min_width', 50));
```

##### Min height

Use this to ensure that the height of an image is equal to or greater than the specified pixels.
```php
$validator->setConstraint('HeroImage', Constraint_dimension::create('min_height', 75));
```

##### Min width and height

Use this to ensure that the width and the height of the image are equal to or greater than the specified pixels.
```php
$validator->setConstraint('HeroImage', Constraint_dimension::create('min_width_height', 50, 75));
```

##### Max width

Use this to ensure that the width of an image is less than or equal to the specified pixels. Handy to ensure that users don't select images far larger than required, especially if these images have a max-width set by CSS as that would result in a lot of wasted bandwidth.
```php
$validator->setConstraint('HeroImage', Constraint_dimension::create('max_width', 300));
```

##### Max height

Use this to ensure the height of an image is less than or equal to the specified pixels.
```php
$validator->setConstraint('HeroImage', Constraint_dimension::create('max_height', 200));
```

##### Max width and height

Use this to ensure the width and height is of an image does not exceed the specified pixels.
```php
$validator->setConstraint('HeroImage', Constraint_dimension::create('max_width_height', 300, 200));
```

## Validation Logic - Conditional Constraints

This feature allows you to specify under what conditions a field should or should not have it's validation constraints applied, based on the value(s) of other fields on the form. The concept borrows heavily from and compliments Uncle Cheese's [Display Logic module](https://github.com/unclecheese/silverstripe-display-logic). Note that no frontend logic is applied, this is backend only. If you use display logic, that will allow you to hide fields that shouldn't be shown/validated on the frontend.

### Validation Logic Examples

You can use the following conditional:

- isEqualTo
- isEmpty
- isGreaterThan
- isLessThan
- contains
- isChecked

```php
$country->validateIf('EmailAddress')->isEqualTo('s')->orIf('EmailAddress')->isEqualTo('v');
```

```php
$field->validateIf('IsChecked')->isEmpty();
```

## Extra validators

You can also use extra validators crafted by the community. The module is shipped with the default validators:
- Comparison
- Words
- Date Iso

Javascript and language files are loaded only if you use these validators.


## No validation

In some scenarios, you don't want to trigger validation when submitting the form (i.e.: "previous" button in a multi step form).
Although this is easy to achieve by yourself, the module provides a standard implementation for doing this.

Instead of using the standard FormAction class, you can use its subclass "FormActionNoValidation". It will prevent the client and server side validation from happening.


## Extending

You can create your own validation constraints by subclassing the abstract ZenValidatorConstraint class. For frontend implementation of your custom validator, see [Parsley.extend.js](https://github.com/guillaumepotier/Parsley.js/blob/master/parsley.extend.js). Unfortunately there is no real documentation other than the code itself at this stage so good luck!

For everything else in the frontend (triggers, error classes, error placement, etc) See the [Parsley.js documentation](http://parsleyjs.org/documentation.html#javascript)
